# lazystyle
Lazystyle is component aimed at solving a problem encountered using react modules. We're creating reusable standalone modules using inline styles the 'react way' which is great until we need an icon font or pseudo class. This is a helper module to lazyload styles needed by the module when it's loaded in a DOM. Also, I have been wanting to use the stylesheet api forever and this was an excellent excuse.

### TODO
- add tests
- accept css, less, styl etc
